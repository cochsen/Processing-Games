Original and Rewritten games in Processing

## Originals

Works in Progress

High Mountain Patrol: a game that expands on Kenta Cho's Prominent Mountain. Dodge boulders and trees while picking up gold and gems by altering the landscape.

McBoo: You're a cranky ghost who must sneak up on your enemies to attack. Your enemies are generation Y hipsters.

Super Vertex: Updated version of Tempest for touchscreen.

## Remakes 

Kenta Cho is a multimedia researcher at Toshiba who comes up with many ingenouos arcade-style casual games in his free time and publishes them under [ABA games](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/). He's a game developer's game developer who's inspired me by taking classic arcade elements and remixing them in original ways. It's definitely a refreshing change from the latest AAA fps, and although I  occassionally get absorbed in RPG's, I tend to favor casual/arcade games you can pick up and put down within  minutes and, of course, casual games can be created on a timescale of hours or days rather than months or years. I'm remaking some of the open-source games from his [blog](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/) in the [Processing](https://processing.org/) Java Framework to get insight into game programming, game mechanics and creative design. Currently I'm working on [From Four Sides](http://abagames.sakura.ne.jp/flash/ffs/).  I plan on porting this to Android and changing the controls from keystrokes to touchscreen and will probably try expanding it into a larger derivative game. 

Another one of his game stubs I'll be attempting to remake soon is [Prominent Mountain](http://abagames.sakura.ne.jp/flash/pm/), which I think has a lot of potential as a touchscreen game since the mechanics are similar to games such a [Canabalt](http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/).
